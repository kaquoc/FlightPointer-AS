## FlightPointer-AS
Android studio app


- **Support for Google Pixel 3A (for now)**

## Application idea
FlightPointer provides a simple app that displays the name and location of the aircraft nearest to the user's longitude and lattitude.
All flight data is provided by https://www.adsbexchange.com/ through RapidAPI.

User can entered their desired search radius. (NOT working under current ADSBx Flight Sim Traffic version). Only ADSBx Flight Sim Traffic version 2 (paid plan) works.


## Learning goals
The purpose of creating this app is to:
- Improve upon my OOP Java skills and its real-world application.
- Learn how to handle receiving HTTP requests, in this case, handling RapidAPI and OKHTTP3 requests.
  - https://square.github.io/okhttp/

- Managing and understanding dependancies with Android Studio and Gradle.
